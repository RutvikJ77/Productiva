## Inspiration
Holidays are the perfect time to get free from yearly hustles. Though there may be times when unavoided bugs or calls/meetings arise. To avoid the perfect procrastination strategy which we might have set up, I came up with a visually stunning Pomodoro timer with Winter theme. 

## What it does
> [The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique)

Productiva is equipped with 2- time crunches of 25 and 50 minutes and additional short breaks of 5 and 10 mins each after a productive session. With visual appeals and most focused task listed, it ensures that you complete the task and spend holidays with family instead of work.

## How I built it
Using basic html5, CSS, Sass and Javascript. Extensive knowledge of web extensions was also required.

## Challenges I ran into
Extension developments quite differ from browser-based development. The rules of Content Security policies of every browser is different and an essential part is that the CSP does not allow you to use the onclick function which means a further hassle in development.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
Having only 10% experience in web development, I find this piece of work to be a giant hill which I successfully climbed. From going to develop countdown timers with animations to implementing background snowfall animation everything seems like magic now. Tracing back when I started, I feel like I am way far from there and have to move way more in the world of web dev. 

## What I learned
Sass which is a preprocessor for CSS and animations involved in CSS. After completing this project I feel I did attain an intermediate experience in the world of JS and overall Web Dev. 

## What's next for Productiva
Implementing a cross browser-based extension and an open-source website for productivity.
